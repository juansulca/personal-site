## Introduction

TinkerPod is an open-source platform designed for makers, creative coders, and designers,
providing hackable and customizable hardware and software. Inspired by the evolution of
multitools and influenced by contemporary open-source hardware and generative art, this project
explores the application of critical making and personal fabrication to open-source hardware.
TinkerPod aims to bridge the gap between specialized engineering tools and accessible, user-
friendly hardware for creative and technical exploration.
