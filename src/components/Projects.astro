            <p>
                In the digital era, where surveillance is omnipresent yet often
                invisible, our art installation, “Ctrl_Space,” brings Michel
                Foucault’s theory of the Panopticon into a contemporary context.
                This interactive installation features three large, mechanical
                eyes, each meticulously crafted to follow the movement of
                visitors, simulating the unnerving sensation of being constantly
                watched.This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, and Arduino to
                enable real-time person detection and servo motor control.

                The Grid
            </h3>
            <p>
                A p5js -based audio-visual installation developed during
                Creation and Computation at OCAD University. When the QR code is
                scanned, each phone is randomly assigned a note from the E Minor
                pentatonic scale, an octave value (low, middle, high) and a
                loop-length (4, 6, 8 & 16 seconds, all clean divisions of 120
                BPM). While playing their respective audio loop, each phone’s
                microphone input is analyzed and when the signal amplitude rises
                above a certain threshold, the screen lights up and random lines
                are drawn, emulating the physical installation structure as well
                as the modern media networks we inhabit and interact with.
                Developed in colaboration with Zubin Isaac, Rutooja K. & Nikhil
                Thomas.

                Colorful Delivery
            </h3>
            <p>
                This project utilizes a given hash value to create a captivating
                color matrix. By converting the hash into a collection of hex
                colors, it dynamically generates a matrix that reflects the
                unique data points. With potential applications in data
                visualization, such as blockchain analysis, this creative tool
                showcases the power of code and its ability to turn data into
                visual art.

                Arduino LMiC adaptation to LoRaWAN v1.1
            </h3>
            <p>
                This project focused on adapting the Arduino LMiC library to
                comply with the LoRaWAN v1.1 specification for A and C devices,
                incorporating enhanced security features and ensuring
                compatibility with the latest standards. The modified library
                offered developers the ability to create robust and secure
                LoRaWAN applications while facilitating seamless integration
                with LoRaWAN v1.1 networks. The project prioritized delivering
                LoRaWAN v1.1 features while minimizing the impact on the
                library's performance. The aim was to provide the researcher and
                developer community with a highly functional and dev-friendly
                LoRaWAN v1.1 implementation.
